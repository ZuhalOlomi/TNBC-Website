# UTBiome Knee Sleeve – Rehabilitation Tracking Platform

## Project Overview
UTBiome Knee Sleeve is an advanced wearable device and web platform designed to monitor knee biomechanics during rehabilitation and athletic training. The device collects high-resolution motion and load data, processes it through a custom analytics pipeline, and delivers actionable insights to users and clinicians through an intuitive dashboard.

The goal of UTBiome is to streamline rehabilitation, improve adherence, and enhance recovery outcomes by integrating real-time data collection, visualization, and analytics in a single platform.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Range of Motion (ROM) Tracking** – Measures flexion and extension during sessions.
- **Progress Dashboards** – Visualizes performance trends with clear graphs.
- **Adherence Analytics** – Identifies patients missing exercises and provides feedback.
- **Motivational Feedback** – Milestones and achievements keep users engaged.
- **Remote Monitoring** – Clinicians can track recovery without in-person visits.

## Competition
Several wearable knee monitoring solutions exist, including:

| Product            | Key Features                        | Limitations                                   |
|------------------- |----------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------- |
| XXX             | XXX           | XXX         |
| XXX       | XXX           | XXX |
| XXX | XXX | XXX  |

**UTBiome differentiates itself by combining:**
